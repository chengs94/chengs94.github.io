	<p align="left">I am currently a third-year PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Washington, 
		with broad interest in statistical learning methods and computational techniques for data 
		with complex structure (e.g. observations over a network or spatial domain). I am working with 
		<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ashojaie/">Dr. Ali Shojaie</a> on 
		theoretical properties of approximate inference techniques for spatial point processes.</p>
	
	<p align="left"> I obtained my MS degree in Biostatistics at Yale University, where I worked with 
		<a href="http://www.crawfordlab.io/">Dr. Forrest Crawford</a>
		on estimating hard-to-reach populations in social networks, and in particular, the large-sample behavior of relevant estimators. 
		Before that, I received my BS in Mathematics at Tongji University in Shanghai, China.</a></p>
